Optimizing LLM Prompt Engineering with Reinforcement Learning

**Description:** Prompt engineering is critical for the development of LLM-based applications, which involves designing and optimizing input prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) toward generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs. Currently, the most common approach is manual prompt design, where users create prompts themselves. However, this method can be time-consuming, ineffective, and suboptimal. Additionally, since language models function as black boxes and do not provide gradient access for discrete tokens, improving prompts through modifications becomes increasingly challenging. 
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a structured method for exploring and optimizing prompts by maximizing task-specific rewards. This approach can automate the prompt engineering process, reducing the dependence on human intuition and enabling the creation of adaptive, high-performing prompts for various tasks. 
In this project, we will investigate automated prompt engineering methods that incorporate reinforcement learning.
